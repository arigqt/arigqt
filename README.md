- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @arigqt
- ğŸ‘€ Having started in Data Science in September 2022, I am looking for a general data culture for the moment. I will specialise more once my first internship is completed. I like to learn about how data science can help and accelerate an ecological transition. I am a sports fan. When I'm not coding, chances are you'll see me wearing trainers.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science at Ecole Polytechnique, near Paris.
